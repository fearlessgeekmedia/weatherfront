# WeatherFront

This is a bash script I created to display current weather conditions, the weather forecast, and a weather radar.

Right now, this only displays information for Salt Lake City. I will be adding the ability to add your location in the future.

## Dependencies
- Ansiweather
- Gum
- Chafa

## Optional Dependencies
- A terminal that supports images, such as Kitty or Ghostty.
  In terminals that don't support images, the script will display an ANSI-based weather radar.
